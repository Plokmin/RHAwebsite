		<h1>Committees</h1>
		<h3>On-Campus</h3>
		<p>The On-campus committee plans everything that RHA does on campus for the residents. We keep Chauncey's stocked with the
			newest DVDs. We plan and run competitive tournaments like Smash Brothers, Texas Hold'em, Holiday Decorating, Res
			Hall Feud, and more. We also show movies outdoors on the big screen, and sponsor an Easter egg hunt in the spring.
			We also take your best ideas on how to improve the on campus living experience and make them a reality.</p>
		<h3>Off-Campus</h3>
		<p>The RHA Off Campus committee plans events that are held off of the Rose-Hulman campus. RHA will often pay for a portion
			of the ticket and organize transportation to make these events more affordable and accessible. Some events include
			trips to Six Flags, Turkey Run, Pacers Games, and highly anticipated movies. The Off Campus committee is also responsible
			for planning the annual Deming Park Cookout which provides free food to all on campus residents.</p>
		<h3>Service</h3>
		<p>Volunteer? Do I have to build a house or help run an orphanage? No, volunteering is so much more than that. Everyday
			we volunteer our time by helping other people out. The service committee focuses on improving the Terre Haute community.
			Several events include helping underprivileged kids at Ryves Hall, hosting Blood Drives and fundraising for local
			charity organizations, as well as the quarterly Give Up A Meal (GUAM) program. Join the service committee to find
			out what service is really all about.</p>
		<h3>Publicity</h3>
		<p>Publicity committee is for those who want to help publicize all of the many R.H.A. events. Some of the responsibilities
			include making the iconic RHA light board being happily in full support of R.H.A. activities, but can vary week to
			week. Frequently, we combine with service to create ‘surblicity’ to create one epic force of a committee. Come check
			it out!</p>
