        I'd like to not some code that seems sketchy to me. We're using "getElementsByTag" to get the radio buttons
        for photo deleting. That means if we add any inputs earlier on the document, we could mess up that part of the
        code. We should probably be using radio button groups instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're using radio buttons completely wrong. We've got redundant button names...
